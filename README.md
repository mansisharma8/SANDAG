Overview

This repository contains the work I conducted as a Data Scientist at the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG). During my time there, I worked on optimizing transportation models and enhancing data analysis processes. My key contributions include comparing model outputs from different versions of the EMME simulation tool, implementing data quality control mechanisms, and developing visualizations and reports to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions in transportation planning.

Key Contributions:

Comparison and analysis of transportation models (EMME 4.3.7 vs. OpenPaths 2024).
Development of automated systems for detecting data anomalies.
Creation of interactive PowerBI dashboards to visualize transportation data.
Enhanced collaboration with cross-functional teams to communicate key insights.

Project Structure
The project is divided into multiple components:

Model Comparison:

Scripts for extracting and comparing data between EMME and OpenPaths models.
Tools used: SQL, Python (pandas, numpy).
Automated Data Quality Control:

SQL-based automated alert system to flag negative or zero values in key data columns (BASEIVTT).
Tools used: SQL, Python.
Visualization & Reporting:

PowerBI dashboards and detailed reports that summarize model comparison results and data analysis.
Tools used: PowerBI, Tableau.
Technologies Used
Languages: Python, SQL
Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
Data Analysis Tools: pandas, numpy, Databricks
Visualization: PowerBI, Tableau
Data Pipeline Tools: AWS S3, AWS Glue, Jenkins
Version Control: Git, GitHub
